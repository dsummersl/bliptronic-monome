This is a simple griffon application that presents a UI representing the
buttons and dials on the bliptronic-monome.

Pre requisites:
 * You must have griffon 0.3+ installed. Go here: http://griffon.codehaus.org/
 * ArduinomeSerial is also required, but I'm assuming if you've already got
   your bliptronic monome then you also got the installation
   instructions...so...go look there.

If you are trying to use any Java monome tools then you will likely need to fix
the Java thats installed on your computer. Currently the 1.6 JDK is not usable
with the underlying OSC libs (I think?). Whatever the issue is, you can fix it
by following the instructions here:

TODO:
- give instructions for running the app w/o requiring griffon.
- cleanup log messages
- add buttons to clear the buttons.
